# Boston-Housing

taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are deﬁned as follows : 

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS: weighted distances to ﬁve Boston employment centers
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 12. 
B: 1000(Bk−0.63)2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 13. 
LSTAT: % lower status of the population
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
We can see that the input attributes have a mixture of units.




This Dataset used more on Regression Analysis.

Imprtant Topics :

1. Clearly explained on differece B/W `R2 Score` & `Adjusted R2 Score`.
two image files are attached for reference & also included in Project file.

2. Normality Assumptions : best way to visualize using Histograms.

3. Coeeicients & Feature Importances.

4. Co-relation 

5. Feature Engineering

Machine Learning Model used :
      
      1. Linear Regression
      2. Ridge & Lasso Regression
      3. Decision Tree
      4. Random Forest
      5. Extra Tree Regression
      6. XGboost 

two new advanced ML models are used for this project i,e. Extra Tree Regression & XGboost.
